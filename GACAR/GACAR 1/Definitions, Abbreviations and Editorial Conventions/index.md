ยง1.1 General Definitions

ACAS-Passive surveillance
The process of tracking another aircraft without interrogating it, by using the other aircraft's extended
squitters. ACAS uses the information obtained via 1090 MHz extended squitter to monitor the need for
active surveillance, but not for any other purpose. Passive surveillance applies to both hybrid and extended
hybrid surveillance.
ATN security services
A set of information security provisions allowing the receiving end system or intermediate system to
unambiguously identify (i.e. authenticate) the source of the received information and to verify the integrity
of that information.
ACAS broadcast
A long Mode S air-air surveillance interrogation (UF = 16) with the broadcast address.
ACAS I
An ACAS which provides information as an aid to "see and avoid" action but does not include the
capability for generating resolution advisories (RAs).
Note - ACAS I is not intended for international implementation and standardization by ICAO. Therefore
only ACAS I characteristics required to ensure compatible operation with other ACAS configurations
and interference limiting are defined in ICAO Annex 10 Vol. IV, Para 4.2.
ACAS II
An ACAS which provides vertical resolution advisories (RAs) in addition to traffic advisories (TAs).
ACAS IMI
An ACAS which provides vertical and horizontal resolution advisories (RAs) in addition to traffic
advisories (TAs).
ACAS-Active surveillance
The process of tracking an intruder by using the information gained from the replies to own ACAS
interrogations.
